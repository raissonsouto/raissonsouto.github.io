              <h1>UFCG (POI): Docker and Kubernetes</h1>
              <h4>October 2022 - Febuary 2023</h4>
              <p>The "Operations Provisioning in Infrastructure" course assigns a project for my team and me to establish a Kubernetes cluster on Google Cloud, deploy an application to the cluster, and perform necessary provisions. We are also required to configure load balancing and conduct stress testing to evaluate the performance and stability of the infrastructure.</p>

              <h1>UFCG (SD): Cryptography</h1>
              <h4>October 2022 - Febuary 2023</h4>
              <p>I served as a monitor in the "Distributed Systems" course. I helped students grasp the fundamental concepts of security, including cryptography, hashing, and digital signatures. To enhance their learning experience, I recorded educational videos and designed interactive activities to solidify their understanding of these important topics.</p>

              <h1>LSD (5G Security): Cybersecurity & Cloud</h1>
              <h4>March 2022 - Currently</h4>
              <p>My first project in cybersecurity, learning about 5G architecture and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) in a security point of view. Focusing in the impact of IMT-2020 on the cloud and MEC applications.</p>

              <h1>Eureca: Software Engineering</h1>
              <h4>June 2022 - August 2022</h4>
              <p>The goal in this course was to having a already running project, improve it using testing and metrics tools. Also, another proposal of  the project was to learn how to deal with a big team, so the group were made of 13 students and I had the honor to be the leader of the group.</p>

              <h1>UFCG (Wordle): Haskell and Prolog</h1>
              <h4>November 2021 - March 2022</h4>
              <p>The course "programming language paradigms" challenged me to create a program from scratch during the semester in languages that use paradigms different from OO. It was very engaging to have to change not only the language but also the way of thinking to solve the problem.</p>

              <h1>LSD: Fogbow</h1>
              <h4>August 2020 - January 2021</h4>
              <p>It was my first contact with a 10.000 or more lines of codes and also with cloud, specifically with Openstack. In that project my goal was to delivery a functionality that allows a cloud operator to pause and unpause VMs deployed at the lab's Openstack.</p>
